We generate tags like [dog]s and [cat]s, which are both[animal]s, you
know?! Then a [generator] will take care of each tag and render a html
out of it. You can then at least expect that [dog]s and [cat]s tags are
linked to the new dog.html and cat.html files (hover your mouse and see
for yourself).

<h3>Then what happen next?</h3>

Should you decide to write your own dog.html inside the source folder,
the generator will simply append the tag linking to this page. So the
dog.html links to this index.html because this file contains a dog-tag.
